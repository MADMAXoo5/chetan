    The term <b>artificial intelligence</b> may be used for
     any computer that has characteristics similar to
      the human brain, including the ability to think critically, make decisions,
       and increase productivity. The foundation of AI is human insights that may be determined in such a manner 
       that machines can easily realize the jobs, from the most simple to the most complicated.

       <h2>HUMAN INTELLIGENCE</h2>
       </p>
       <p>The origins of human intelligence and conduct may be
         traced back to the individual's unique combination of <BR> 
         genetics, upbringing, and exposure to various situation
         s and environments. And it hinges entirely</BR> on one's free
         dom to shape his or her environment via the application o
         f newly acquired information

            The most noticeable effect of AI has been the result of the
             <b>digitalization and automation</b> of formerly manual processes 
             across a wide range of industries. These tasks, which were 
             formerly performed manually, are now performed digitally.
              Currently, tasks or occupations that involve some degree of 
              repetition or the use and interpretation of large amounts of
               data are communicated to and administered by a computer, and 
               in certain cases, the intervention of humans is not required
                in order to complete these tasks or jobs.

            Artificial intelligence is creating new opportunities for the workforce
             by automating formerly <b>human-intensive tasks.</b> The rapid development of
              technology has resulted in the emergence of new fields of study and work,
               such as digital engineering. Therefore, although traditional manual labor jobs
                may go extinct, new opportunities and careers will emerge.
